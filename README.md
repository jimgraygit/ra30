///RA30 - 220524a

///What is RA30?
RA30 is an SD card overhaul for the Miyoo A30 with a patched MainUI launcher and a preconfigured Retroarch setup. The short term goal is to create a more consistent and optimized experience across the device. As with the original Onion v1.0, this is meant to be a stopgap until bigger and better solutions come along. 

///Features:
- Patched MainUI with no “Retroarch” section
- Clock speed set per system to provide a balance of battery and performance.
- Removed Miyoo’s in-game menu and replaced with Retroarch menus.
- Fully pre-configured Retroarch build with no bloat, cleaner menus, intuitive hotkeys and quick access to the features that make sense on an underpowered budget device like the A30.

///Known Issues, please report in the Retro Handhelds discord if you discover solutions:
- Occasionally the entire RetroArch UI bugs out, I think that just kinda is what it is until we have a recompiled Retroarch
- Crashes and freezes are not common but every CPU handles overclocking differently.

///How to install:
Drag and drop contents to the root of a FAT32 formatted SD card.
Drag your BIOS files into the BIOS folder.
Drag your ROMs into the corresponding console’s ROMS folder.
Drag your box art into the system's corresponding IMGs folder.
